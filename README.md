## Results

### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the MechaCar_mpg.csv file.

### Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition in terms of ownership. 

Null Hypothesis (Ho): MechaCar is more economic to own based on performance metrics.
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): MechaCar is not economic to own based on performance metrics.

Factors to test would include cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, and maintenance cost.

A multiple linear regression could be used to determine which factors have the highest correlation to see if can reject or fail to rejct the null hypothesis.
